    this class should be a root router of the FastAPI app when using header based
    versioning. It will be used to route the requests to the correct versioned route
    based on the headers. It also supports waterflowing the requests to the latest
    version of the API if the request header doesn't match any of the versions.

    If the app has two versions: 2022-01-02 and 2022-01-05, and the request header
    is 2022-01-03, then the request will be routed to 2022-01-02 version as it the closest
    version, but lower than the request header.

    Exact match is always preferred over partial match and a request will never be
    matched to the higher versioned route
